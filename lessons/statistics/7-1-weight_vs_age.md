[Think Stats Chapter 7 Exercise 1](http://greenteapress.com/thinkstats2/html/thinkstats2008.html#toc70) (weight vs. age)

>> We see little relationship between variables from the scatterplot. The Pearson's is around 0.07, Spearman's is around 0.09, which suggest there may be effect of outliers or non-linear relationship. lotting percentiles of weight versus age suggests that the relationship is non-linear.  Birth weight increases more quickly in the range of mother's age from 15 to 25.  After that, the effect is weaker.
